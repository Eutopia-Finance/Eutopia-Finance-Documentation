# Understanding Rebase Token

### Understanding Rebase Token

#### What is a Rebase Token? <a href="#what-is-a-rebase-token" id="what-is-a-rebase-token"></a>

A Rebase Token is a type of cryptocurrency whose circulating supply expands or contracts based on changes in the token's price. This adjustment mechanism is known as rebasing. During a rebase, the token supply is algorithmically increased or decreased according to the current price of each token.

#### Eutopia's Positive Rebase Formula <a href="#eutopias-positive-rebase-formula" id="eutopias-positive-rebase-formula"></a>

Eutopia’s EASP leverages a positive rebase formula that increases the token supply, allowing $EUTO holders to grow their tokens similarly to traditional staking protocols. However, using a rebasing token eliminates the need to approve and traditionally stake your tokens.

#### Backing the Positive Rebase <a href="#backing-the-positive-rebase" id="backing-the-positive-rebase"></a>

The positive rebase mechanism is supported by an Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR), which is maintained and supported through the token’s buy and sell fees.

By understanding the concept of a rebase token and Eutopia's innovative approach, $EUTO holders can benefit from continuous growth in their token holdings without the complexities of traditional staking.
