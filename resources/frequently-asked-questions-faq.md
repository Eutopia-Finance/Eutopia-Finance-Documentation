# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **What Makes Eutopia Special and Different from Other DeFi Projects?**

Eutopia utilizes the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP), which channels value directly to $EUTO holders rather than accumulating a large treasury. This approach provides immediate value to token holders and aims to unify the community to build collective wealth and power, distinguishing it from other DeFi projects.

### **How Does the Rebase Work?**

The rebase mechanism adjusts the token supply based on price fluctuations. Eutopia uses a positive rebase formula to increase the $EUTO supply for each holder, expanding the token supply proportionally.

### **How to Stake?**

Eutopia's autostaking feature simplifies staking rewards. By holding $EUTO in your wallet, you automatically receive staking rewards without needing to transfer or lock tokens.

### **How Do I Get My Rebase Rewards?**

Rebase rewards are received by holding $EUTO tokens in your wallet, as they are distributed automatically during each rebase period.

### **When Does the Rebase Occur?**

Rebases occur every 30 minutes, distributing 0.03958% of the tokens in your wallet as staking rewards. The next rebase can be tracked on the Eutopia staking dashboard.

### **How is the APY Sustained?**

Eutopia sustains its fixed APY through buy-and-sell taxes (13% for buys and 18% for sells) and weekly burns (0.475% of the total token supply). This structure helps maintain the APY and mitigate inflation.

### **What Will We Do with the Treasury?**

The Treasury provides financial support for the Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR) to stabilize the $EUTO token price during extreme price drops and funds new Eutopia products and services.

### **Eutopiaâ€™s Utility Plans**

Eutopia plans to expand its ecosystem with new features and partnerships, including NFTs, a mobile app, cross-chain functionality, and merchandise.
