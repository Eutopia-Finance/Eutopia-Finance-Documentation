# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP)?

The Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) is a decentralized financial protocol that automatically stakes EUTO within users' wallets, offering high, consistent returns without the need for manual intervention.

### How does EASP work?

EASP automatically stakes your EUTO as soon as you acquire them, without requiring any off-platform transfers. It also reinvests the staking rewards at regular intervals, maximizing returns through continuous compounding.

### What is EUTO?

EUTO is the native token of the Eutopia ecosystem, which powers the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP). It is an ERC20-compliant token on the Ethereum blockchain.

### What is the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of EASP?

EASP offers a fixed APY of <mark style="color:purple;">**146,847.85%**</mark>, which equates to a daily Return on Investment (ROI) of <mark style="color:purple;">**2.0181%**</mark>.

### How often are rebase rewards distributed?

Rebase rewards in EASP are distributed every <mark style="color:purple;">**15**</mark> minutes, making it one of the fastest autostaking protocols in the market.

### What is auto compounding in EASP?

Auto compounding in EASP automatically reinvests your staking rewards back into the protocol at regular intervals, allowing your EUTO holdings to grow exponentially without manual effort.

### Do I need to lock or stake my EUTO tokens to earn rewards?

No, there is no need to lock or stake your tokens on a separate platform. With EASP, your Eutopia tokens are automatically staked in your wallet, and rewards are earned continuously.

### What is the Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR)?

The ESSR is a financial reserve within the Eutopia ecosystem that stabilizes the token's supply and price, particularly during periods of high market volatility. It is funded through transaction fees.

### How does EASP maintain the token price?

EASP uses game theory and behavioral economics to predict and respond to token holder actions, ensuring price stability and consistent rebase rewards.

### What fees are associated with EASP?

EASP employs a dynamic fee structure, with fees allocated to liquidity pools, the treasury, and the ESSR to support the protocol's stability and growth.

### Can I manually rebase my tokens?

Yes, while EASP automatically performs rebase operations, you can also manually trigger a rebase if you meet the necessary conditions.

### Is EASP safe and secure?

Yes, EASP is built with security in mind, incorporating features like reentrancy guards, fee exemptions for key addresses, and access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized actions are performed.

### What is the purpose of the Uniswap integration?

Uniswap integration allows EUTO to be traded easily, providing liquidity and enabling seamless exchanges between EUTO and other cryptocurrencies.

### How does EASP handle large sell orders?

The Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR) absorbs the impact of large sell orders by injecting liquidity into the market, thereby stabilizing the token price.

### What happens if I sell my EUTO?

When you sell your EUTO, a portion of the transaction is allocated to the ESSR, liquidity pools, and treasury as part of the protocolâ€™s fee structure.

### How does EASP compare to other staking protocols?

EASP simplifies the staking process by automating staking and compounding directly in your wallet, offering a fixed, high APY with frequent rebase rewards, making it more user-friendly than traditional staking protocols.

### What is the total supply of EUTO?

The total supply of EUTO is capped at <mark style="color:purple;">**4,000,000,000**</mark>, ensuring scarcity and potential value appreciation as the protocol grows.

### How does the protocol ensure long-term sustainability?

EASP ensures sustainability through dynamic fee structures, the ESSR, and strategic treasury management, which together maintain high yields while supporting the protocol's long-term growth.

### Can I participate in governance with EUTO?

Yes, EUTO holders have a say in the governance of the Eutopia ecosystem, allowing them to influence decisions and the future direction of the protocol.
