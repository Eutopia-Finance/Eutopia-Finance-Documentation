### What Makes Eutopia Special and Different from Other DeFi Projects? <a href="#what-makes-eutopia-special-and-different-from-other-defi-projects" id="what-makes-eutopia-special-and-different-from-other-defi-projects"></a>

Eutopia is a groundbreaking protocol that aims to establish a new decentralized model in DeFi. The EASP protocol channels the value generated by the project directly into the wallets of Eutopia holders instead of accumulating a large treasury. This approach delivers immediate value to token holders and fosters a community eager to see the project succeed. Our objective is to unite the community into a cohesive, focused unit to build wealth and power. This novel concept in DeFi has made Eutopia one of the most exciting projects in the space.

### How Does the Rebase Work? <a href="#how-does-the-rebase-work" id="how-does-the-rebase-work"></a>

The rebase mechanism allows the token supply to expand or contract based on changes in token price. This process, called rebasing, uses a positive rebase formula to increase the $EUTO supply for each holder.

### How to Stake <a href="#how-to-stake" id="how-to-stake"></a>

### How Do I Get My Rebase Rewards? <a href="#how-do-i-get-my-rebase-rewards" id="how-do-i-get-my-rebase-rewards"></a>

Rebase rewards are essentially staking rewards. You receive rebase rewards by holding $EUTO in your wallet.

### How is the APY Sustained? <a href="#how-is-the-apy-sustained" id="how-is-the-apy-sustained"></a>

Eutopia uses buy-and-sell taxes to sustain its fixed APY. When users buy $EUTO, 13% of their purchase supports the protocol; when they sell, 18% supports it. Additional utilities reduce pressure on the APY, and weekly burns of 0.475% of the total token supply help control inflation.

### Is Eutopia a DAO/OHM Fork? <a href="#is-eutopia-a-dao-ohm-fork" id="is-eutopia-a-dao-ohm-fork"></a>

Eutopia is not a DAO. It is a new type of protocol that uses buy and sell fees of 13% and 18%, respectively, to sustain its APY. Eutopia also offers autostaking, where tokens start earning immediately upon purchase without traditional staking.

### What Will We Do with the Treasury? <a href="#what-will-we-do-with-the-treasury" id="what-will-we-do-with-the-treasury"></a>

The Treasury provides additional financial support for the ESSR in case of extreme price drops of the $EUTO token. It also funds new Eutopia products, services, and projects that enhance the EASP use cases and the Eutopia economy.
