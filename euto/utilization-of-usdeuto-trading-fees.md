# Utilization of $EUTO Trading Fees

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Eutopia's buy and sell fees are integral to the EASP. These fees generate capital for essential protocol functions, as outlined in the Eutopia Token section of this White Paper.

Unlike other protocols that rely on selling bonds to perform similar functions, we believe this approach is riskier. If bonds are not purchased, the token can lose support and experience a price decline, as seen with several bond-based protocols.

Selling bonds also disadvantages token holders by reducing the potential APY and eliminating the ability to offer a stable APY.

The fee structure (13% for buys and 18% for sells) allows Eutopia to provide $EUTO holders with a stable high yield of 102,483.58% annually.
