# Eutopia Autostaking Protocol

#### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Eutopia is poised to spearhead a revolution in decentralized finance (DeFi) with the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP), a pioneering financial protocol designed to simplify staking and provide $EUTO token holders with unparalleled stable returns.

The EASP endows the Eutopia token with automatic staking and compounding functionalities, delivering the highest fixed Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in the market at 102,483.58%, which translates to a daily Return On Investment (ROI) of 1.917%.

#### Simplicity and Security <a href="#simplicity-and-security" id="simplicity-and-security"></a>

We offer autostaking directly in your wallet upon purchasing $EUTO. You don't need to transfer your tokens to our website. When you acquire $EUTO, you are staked and poised to receive rebase rewards. It is the simplest autostaking mechanism in DeFi.

#### Consistent APY <a href="#consistent-apy" id="consistent-apy"></a>

Fluctuating APYs make predicting the number of tokens you will receive challenging. Other DeFi protocols offer high APYs that can vary by up to 90% in a single day. EASP, however, provides $EUTO holders with a fixed interest rate of 1.917% daily, which, when compounded, amounts to an industry-leading 102,483.58% annually.

#### Rapid Rebase Rewards <a href="#rapid-rebase-rewards" id="rapid-rebase-rewards"></a>

Other prominent staking protocols distribute rebasing rewards every 8 hours, necessitating precise timing to maximize returns when unstaking. The Eutopia Autostaking Protocol, in contrast, pays out every 30 minutes, or 48 times daily, making it the fastest autostaking protocol in the crypto space.

#### Strategic Price and Reward Support <a href="#strategic-price-and-reward-support" id="strategic-price-and-reward-support"></a>

The EASP leverages a sophisticated combination of factors to maintain its price and rebase rewards. It employs game theory and insights into human behavior to anticipate the likely actions of token purchasers. Our development team has meticulously coordinated these elements to function seamlessly behind the scenes, resulting in an elegant and straightforward staking and rewards system for $EUTO holders.

#### Versatility and Potential <a href="#versatility-and-potential" id="versatility-and-potential"></a>

The EASP is both flexible and robust, serving as the foundation for a wide array of Eutopia products, services, and projects. Each initiative aims to revolutionize different facets of the cryptocurrency landscape.

#### Buy-Hold-Earn Mechanism <a href="#buy-hold-earn-mechanism" id="buy-hold-earn-mechanism"></a>

The EASP Autostake feature, known as Buy-Hold-Earn, offers maximum convenience for $EUTO holders by allowing them to earn rebase rewards directly. Simply purchasing and holding $EUTO in your wallet will increase your token balance every 30 minutes.

#### Positive Rebase Formula <a href="#positive-rebase-formula" id="positive-rebase-formula"></a>

Eutopia employs a Positive Rebase formula, enabling daily token distribution directly proportional to the daily rebase rewards, which amount to 1.917% of the total $EUTO tokens held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed during each epoch (rebase period) to all $EUTO holders. Consequently, without moving their tokens from their wallets, Eutopia holders receive an annual compound interest of 102,483.58%.
