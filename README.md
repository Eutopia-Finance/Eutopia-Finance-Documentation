# Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) Technical Overview

### **Introduction**

Eutopia is set to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) with the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP). This innovative financial protocol simplifies staking mechanics and ensures $EUTO token holders receive stable returns.

The EASP integrates automatic staking and compounding functionalities, providing the highest fixed Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in the market at 146,847.85%, equating to a daily Return on Investment (ROI) of 1.02%.

Eutopia's auto compounding feature automatically reinvests staking rewards into the pool at regular intervals, maximizing returns through continuous compound interest. This process ensures that $EUTO token holders benefit from exponential growth without manual input, optimizing yield efficiency and simplifying the staking experience.

### **Key Features**

1. **Simplicity and Security:**
   * Autostaking is enabled directly in the user's wallet upon purchasing $EUTO tokens, eliminating the need for off-platform transfers.
   * Upon acquisition of $EUTO, tokens are automatically staked, and holders are immediately eligible for rebase rewards.
   * This mechanism represents the simplest autostaking system in the DeFi space.
2. **Consistent APY:**
   * Unlike other DeFi protocols with fluctuating APYs, EASP offers a fixed daily interest rate of 1.917%.
   * This fixed rate, when compounded, results in an annual yield of 102,483.58%, providing predictability and reliability for $EUTO holders.
3. **Rapid Rebase Rewards:**
   * EASP distributes rebase rewards every 30 minutes (48 times per day), making it the fastest autostaking protocol in the cryptocurrency market.
   * This frequency contrasts with other protocols that typically distribute rewards every 8 hours.
4. **Strategic Price and Reward Support:**
   * EASP utilizes game theory and behavioral economics to predict and respond to token holder actions.
   * The protocol's design ensures seamless integration of these predictive mechanisms, maintaining price stability and consistent rebase rewards.
5. **Versatility and Potential:**
   * EASP serves as the backbone for Eutopia's diverse range of products, services, and projects, each designed to transform various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
6. **Buy-Hold-Earn Mechanism:**
   * The autostaking feature, branded as Buy-Hold-Earn, allows $EUTO holders to earn rebase rewards automatically by holding tokens in their wallets.
   * Token balances increase every 30 minutes, providing a continuous and effortless earning mechanism.
7. **Positive Rebase Formula:**
   * Eutopia employs a Positive Rebase formula, ensuring daily token distribution proportional to the daily rebase rewards.
   * Each epoch (rebase period) grants 1.917% of the total $EUTO tokens held to holders, resulting in an annual compound interest rate of 102,483.58%.
   * Rebase rewards are distributed without requiring token transfers, maintaining security and convenience for holders.

### **Mathematical Formulations**

* **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**

$$
\text{APY} = \left(1 + \frac{\text{Daily ROI}}{100}\right)^{365} - 1
$$

* **Daily Rebase Calculation**

$$
\text{Epoch Rebase Reward Rate} = 1.0003958125
$$

$$
\text{Daily ROI} = (\text{Epoch Rebase Reward Rate}^{48} - 1) \times 100
$$
