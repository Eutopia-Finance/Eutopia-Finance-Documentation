# Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) Technical Overview

### **Introduction**

Eutopia is set to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) with the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP). This innovative financial protocol simplifies staking mechanics and ensures $EUTO token holders receive stable returns.

The EASP integrates automatic staking and compounding functionalities, providing the highest fixed Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in the market at 146,847.85%, equating to a daily Return on Investment (ROI) of 2.0181 %.

Eutopia's auto compounding feature automatically reinvests staking rewards into the pool at regular intervals, maximizing returns through continuous compound interest. This process ensures that $EUTO token holders benefit from exponential growth without manual input, optimizing yield efficiency and simplifying the staking experience.

### **Key Features**

1. **Simplicity and Security:**
   * Autostaking is enabled directly in the user's wallet upon purchasing $EUTO tokens, eliminating the need for off-platform transfers.
   * Upon acquisition of $EUTO, tokens are automatically staked, and holders are immediately eligible for rebase rewards.
   * This mechanism represents the simplest autostaking system in the DeFi space.
2. **Consistent APY:**
   * Unlike other DeFi protocols with fluctuating APYs, EASP offers a fixed daily interest rate of 2.0181%.
   * This fixed rate, when compounded, results in an annual yield of 146,847.85%, providing predictability and reliability for $EUTO holders.
3. **Rapid Rebase Rewards:**
   * EASP distributes rebase rewards every 15 minutes (96 times per day), making it the fastest autostaking protocol in the cryptocurrency market.
   * This frequency contrasts with other protocols that typically distribute rewards every 8 hours.
4. **Strategic Price and Reward Support:**
   * EASP utilizes game theory and behavioral economics to predict and respond to token holder actions.
   * The protocol's design ensures seamless integration of these predictive mechanisms, maintaining price stability and consistent rebase rewards.
5. **Versatility and Potential:**
   * EASP serves as the backbone for Eutopia's diverse range of products, services, and projects, each designed to transform various aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

### **Mathematical Formulations**

Eutopia employs a Positive Rebase formula, ensuring daily token distribution proportional to the daily rebase rewards. Each epoch (rebase period) grants 2.0181% of the total $EUTO tokens held to holders, resulting in an annual compound interest rate of 146,847.85%. Rebase rewards are distributed without requiring token transfers, maintaining security and convenience for holders.

* **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**

$$
\text{APY} = \left(1 + \frac{\text{Daily ROI}}{100}\right)^{365} - 1 = 1,468.4785
$$

* **Daily Rebase Calculation**

$$
\text{Reward Epoch} = 900 seconds (15 minutes)
$$

$$
\text{Reward Distribution Count Per Day} = 96
$$

$$
\text{Reward Rate Per Epoch} = 1.0002081456
$$

$$
\text{Reward Rate Per Day} = {Reward Rate Per Epoch}^{Reward Distribution Count Per Day}
$$

$$
\text{Daily ROI} = (\text{Reward Rate Per Day} - 1) \times 100 = 2.0181
$$

The Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) is designed to provide $EUTO token holders with a secure, reliable, and high-yielding staking experience, leveraging advanced mathematical models and economic theories to ensure optimal performance and stability.
