# Understanding Rebase Token

### Rebase Token Explained

A Rebase Token is a type of cryptocurrency with a circulating supply that dynamically expands or contracts based on the token's price fluctuations. This adjustment mechanism, known as rebasing, algorithmically modifies the token supply to reflect the current market price per token.

### Eutopia's Positive Rebase Formula

Eutopia's Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) employs a positive rebase formula designed to augment the token supply, enabling $EUTO holders to increase their token holdings analogously to conventional staking protocols. The utilization of a rebasing token obviates the necessity for approval and traditional staking processes.

### Mechanism Supporting Positive Rebase

The positive rebase mechanism is underpinned by an Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR), which is funded and sustained through transaction fees incurred during the buying and selling of the token.

By comprehending the concept of a rebase token and Eutopia's innovative implementation, $EUTO holders can achieve continual growth in their token holdings, circumventing the complexities associated with traditional staking methods.

### Auto Compounding for Maximum Yield

One of the key features of Eutopia's EASP is the automatic compounding of staking rewards. Unlike traditional staking protocols where users must manually reinvest their rewards, Eutopia's auto compounding feature continuously reinvests rebase rewards back into the pool. This process ensures that $EUTO holders benefit from exponential growth in their token balance, maximizing their returns without requiring any manual intervention.

### No Need to Lock or Stake Tokens

Another significant advantage of the $EUTO token within the EASP is the elimination of the need to lock or stake tokens to earn rewards. As soon as users acquire $EUTO tokens, they are automatically staked in their wallets, and they begin to receive rebase rewards without any additional steps. This seamless integration allows users to maintain full control over their tokens while still benefiting from the rewards, providing a user-friendly and flexible approach to earning in the DeFi space.
