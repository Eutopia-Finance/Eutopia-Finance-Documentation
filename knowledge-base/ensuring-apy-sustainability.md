# Ensuring APY Sustainability

#### Positive Scenario: Supporting Rewards

Eutopia has established a robust Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR) framework that leverages trading volume fees to fund staking rewards (rebase rewards) when the ETH/EUTO pair supply reaches 2.5% of the total supply. When daily ESSR gains meet or exceed the total Holders' Daily ROI, the Swap Threshold can accommodate the additional value generated from the Rebase Rewards.

#### Negative Scenario: Utilizing Treasury Support

In scenarios where daily ESSR gains are insufficient to cover the Holders' Daily ROI, a portion of the Treasury is allocated to compensate for the shortfall.

#### Self-Equalizing Mechanism

This mechanism creates a self-balancing system that ensures consistently high returns for all $EUTO token holders over time.

#### APY Calculation

APY is calculated from the reward yield (rebase rate) using the following formula:

$$
\text{APY} = \left(1 + \text{Reward Yield}\right)^{17,520} - 1
$$

The exponent 17,520 accounts for the 48 rebase events that occur daily, multiplied by 365 days in a year.

By comprehending Eutopia's methodology for supporting its APY, $EUTO holders can be assured of the sustainability and reliability of their staking rewards.
