# Ensuring APY Sustainability

### Positive Scenario: Supporting Rewards <a href="#positive-scenario-supporting-rewards" id="positive-scenario-supporting-rewards"></a>

Eutopia has implemented a robust Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR) structure that utilizes trading volume fees to support staking rewards (rebase rewards) when the ETH/EUTO pair supply equals 2.5% of the total supply. When the daily ESSR gains are greater than or equal to the total Holders' Daily ROI, the Swap Threshold can cover the additional value generated from the Rebase Rewards.

### Negative Scenario: Utilizing Treasury Support <a href="#negative-scenario-utilizing-treasury-support" id="negative-scenario-utilizing-treasury-support"></a>

If the daily ESSR gains fall short of the Holders' Daily ROI, a portion of the Treasury is used to make up the difference.

### Self-Equalizing Mechanism <a href="#self-equalizing-mechanism" id="self-equalizing-mechanism"></a>

This creates a self-equalizing system that ensures consistently high returns over time for every $EUTO token holder.

### APY Calculation <a href="#apy-calculation" id="apy-calculation"></a>

The APY is derived from the reward yield (also known as the rebase rate) using the following equation:

$$
\text{APY} = (1 + \text{reward yield})^{17,520}
$$

The exponent 17,520 accounts for the 48 rebases that occur daily, multiplied by 365 days in a year.

By understanding Eutopia's method for backing its APY, $EUTO holders can be confident in the sustainability and reliability of their staking rewards.
