# Understanding Rebase Token

### Rebase Token Explained

A Rebase Token is a type of cryptocurrency with a circulating supply that dynamically expands or contracts based on the token's price fluctuations. This adjustment mechanism, known as rebasing, algorithmically modifies the token supply to reflect the current market price per token.

### Eutopia's Positive Rebase Formula

Eutopia's Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) employs a positive rebase formula designed to augment the token supply, enabling $EUTO holders to increase their token holdings analogously to conventional staking protocols. The utilization of a rebasing token obviates the necessity for approval and traditional staking processes.

### Mechanism Supporting Positive Rebase

The positive rebase mechanism is underpinned by an Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR), which is funded and sustained through transaction fees incurred during the buying and selling of the token.

By comprehending the concept of a rebase token and Eutopia's innovative implementation, $EUTO holders can achieve continual growth in their token holdings, circumventing the complexities associated with traditional staking methods.
