# Understanding Annual Percentage Yield (APY)

### APY Explained

**Annual Percentage Yield (APY)** measures the effective annual rate of return on a principal token amount by incorporating the effects of compounding interest. Within the Eutopia ecosystem, $EUTO tokens represent the principal, with compound interest applied periodically during each Rebase event (every 30 minutes).

### Mechanics of APY

* **Principal Calculation**: The new principal amount consists of the current $EUTO token balance plus the newly added rebase token amount.
* **Rebase Rewards**: This total principal is then utilized to compute the subsequent rebase rewards.

### Exponential Growth with APY

APY facilitates exponential, rather than linear, growth of token balances over time. With a daily compound interest rate of 1.917%, an initial balance of 1 $EUTO on day 1 would grow to approximately 1025.84 $EUTO after one year, demonstrating the power of compound interest.

By leveraging APY within the Eutopia ecosystem, $EUTO holders can achieve substantial, compounded growth in their token holdings over time.
