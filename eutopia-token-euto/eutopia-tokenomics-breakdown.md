# Eutopia Tokenomics Breakdown

## Token Distribution

The EUTO tokenomics are strategically designed to ensure the sustainable growth and development of the Eutopia ecosystem. Each category has been carefully allocated to align with the project's objectives and long-term vision.

1.  Airdrop: 2.5%

    The airdrop allocation is reserved for rewarding early adopters and fostering community engagement. This distribution method is aimed at creating initial awareness and incentivizing participation in the Eutopia ecosystem. By allocating 2.5% of the total supply to airdrops, EUTO ensures that early supporters are rewarded and motivated to spread the word about the project.
2.  Presale: 37.5%

    The presale allocation constitutes the largest portion of the token distribution. This round is crucial for raising the necessary funds to support the foundational development of the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP) and other key operations. By offering tokens at a discounted rate during the presale, EUTO allows early investors to secure their positions at the most advantageous prices, thereby fueling the project's initial growth and development.
3.  Development: 7.5%

    The development fund is dedicated to the ongoing technical and infrastructural growth of the Eutopia ecosystem. This allocation will be used to finance the continuous enhancement of the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP), integration of new features, and scaling of the platform to meet the demands of a growing user base. A 7.5% allocation ensures that the project has the necessary resources to evolve and adapt over time.
4.  Marketing: 7.5%

    Marketing plays a vital role in expanding the reach and adoption of the Eutopia project. The 7.5% allocation for marketing will be utilized to execute strategic campaigns, partnerships, and community-building activities. These efforts will focus on increasing brand awareness, driving user acquisition, and positioning EUTO as a leading token in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.
5.  Core Contributors & Partnership: 10%

    This allocation is set aside to incentivize core contributors and forge strategic partnerships. Core contributors, including developers, advisors, and key stakeholders, will receive rewards to ensure their continued commitment to the project. Additionally, the 10% allocation will be used to establish and nurture partnerships that align with Eutopia’s long-term vision, enhancing the ecosystem's value proposition.
6.  Liquidity: 15%

    Liquidity is essential for the smooth functioning of any token in the market. The 15% allocation to liquidity will ensure that there is adequate liquidity for trading on exchanges, minimizing price volatility and enhancing market stability. This allocation will also facilitate seamless buying and selling of EUTO tokens, contributing to a healthy and stable market environment.
7.  Community & Rewards: 20%

    The community and rewards allocation is designed to incentivize active participation and loyalty within the Eutopia ecosystem. This 20% allocation will fund various reward programs, such as staking rewards, community contests, and other incentive mechanisms. By prioritizing community engagement, EUTO aims to build a strong, vibrant, and loyal user base that actively contributes to the project’s growth and success.
