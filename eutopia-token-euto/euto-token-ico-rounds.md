# EUTO Token ICO Rounds

## Airdrop Round

* Date: 08/15/2024 - 08/17/2024
* Token Distribution: 100,000,000 EUTO (2.5%)
* Target Audience: Early community members, social media participants, and referral program participants.

The EUTO Airdrop is designed to reward early supporters and create initial buzz around the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP). A total of 100,000,000 EUTO tokens will be distributed to participants who engage with the project through social media, community activities, and referral programs. This round is essential for building a strong and loyal community before the official Seed Round begins. Participants will gain early access to EUTO tokens, giving them a stake in the project's success from the very start.

Key Points:

1. Engagement Focus: Participants will need to complete specific tasks such as following Eutopia on social media, joining the community channels, sharing content, and referring others to the project.
2. Fair Distribution: Each participant will receive a share of the 100,000,000 EUTO tokens based on their level of engagement and the number of tasks completed.
3. Incentivizing Early Adoption: The airdrop is aimed at incentivizing early adoption, creating awareness, and generating initial liquidity for the EUTO token once it becomes publicly tradable.
4. No Purchase Necessary: Unlike the ICO rounds, the airdrop does not require participants to purchase tokens. It serves as a free distribution to kickstart the community and reward early engagement.
