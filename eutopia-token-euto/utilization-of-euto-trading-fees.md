# Utilization of EUTO Trading Fees

### Overview

Eutopia's buy and sell fees are fundamental to the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP). These fees generate essential capital for protocol functions, differentiating from bond-based protocols which can risk token support and price stability if bonds are not purchased.

### Breakdown of Trading Fees

**Buy Trading Fees:**

* **3%** - Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR)
* **5%** - Liquidity Sustain
* **5%** - Treasury

**Sell Trading Fees:**

* **5%** - Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR)
* **5%** - Liquidity Sustain
* **8%** - Treasury

### Placement of Trading Fees

#### Elastic Supply Stability Reserve (ESSR) Support

* **3%** of buys and **5%** of sales are allocated to the ESSR to sustain staking rewards provided by the Positive Rebase.

#### **Liquidity Support**

* **5%** of trading fees enhance the liquidity of the ETH/EUTO pair, ensuring increasing collateral value for EUTO.

#### **Treasury Support**

* **5%** of buys and **8%** of sales are directed to the Treasury. This supports the ESSR value, funds marketing, and backs new project development.

By understanding this fee structure, EUTO holders can appreciate Eutopia's strategic approach to maintaining high yields and supporting protocol growth and stability.
