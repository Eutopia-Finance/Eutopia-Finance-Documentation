# Utilization of $EUTO Trading Fees

### Overview

Eutopia's buy and sell fees are fundamental to the Eutopia Autostaking Protocol (EASP). These fees generate essential capital for protocol functions, differentiating from bond-based protocols which can risk token support and price stability if bonds are not purchased.

### Breakdown of Trading Fees

**Buy Trading Fees:**

* **3%** - Reserve Stability Pool (RSP)
* **5%** - Liquidity Sustain
* **5%** - Treasury

**Sell Trading Fees:**

* **5%** - Reserve Stability Pool (RSP)
* **5%** - Liquidity Sustain
* **8%** - Treasury

### Placement of Trading Fees

**Reserve Stability Pool (RSP) Support**

* **3%** of buys and **5%** of sales are allocated to the RSP to sustain staking rewards provided by the Positive Rebase.

### **Liquidity Support**

* **5%** of trading fees enhance the liquidity of the ETH/EUTO pair, ensuring increasing collateral value for $EUTO.

### **Treasury Support**

* **5%** of buys and **8%** of sales are directed to the Treasury. This supports the RSP value, funds marketing, and backs new project development.

By understanding this fee structure, $EUTO holders can appreciate Eutopia's strategic approach to maintaining high yields and supporting protocol growth and stability.
