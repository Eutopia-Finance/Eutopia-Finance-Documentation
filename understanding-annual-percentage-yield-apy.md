# Understanding Annual Percentage Yield (APY)

### Understanding Annual Percentage Yield (APY)

#### What is APY? <a href="#what-is-apy" id="what-is-apy"></a>

APY, or Annual Percentage Yield, measures the real rate of return on your principal token amount by accounting for the effects of compounding interest. For the Eutopia ecosystem, your $EUTO tokens represent your principal, and compound interest is added periodically during each Rebase event (every 30 minutes).

#### How APY Works <a href="#how-apy-works" id="how-apy-works"></a>

Your new principal amount consists of your current $EUTO token balance plus the new rebase token amount. This total is then used to calculate your next rebase rewards.

#### Exponential Growth with APY <a href="#exponential-growth-with-apy" id="exponential-growth-with-apy"></a>

One fascinating aspect of APY is that your balance grows exponentially over time, not linearly. With a daily compound interest rate of 1.917%, starting with a balance of 1 $EUTO on day 1, your balance would grow to approximately 1025.84 $EUTO after one year. This illustrates the power of compound interest!

By leveraging APY within the Eutopia ecosystem, $EUTO holders can benefit from significant, compounded growth in their token holdings over time.
